== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a mobile website redirect? =

Before smartphone users can see the mobile-optimized version of a website, the site owner must insert a redirect script into the index.html file on their regular website. The DudaMobile Website for WordPress plugin removes this hassle and automatically redirects your WordPress site to the mobile-optimized site when someone visits from their mobile device.

= How do I activate the mobile website redirect? =

Go to WordPress Control Panel. Click "DudaMobile" on your left-column menu. Go to "Redirect mobile users to" on the right hand of your WordPress Control Panel. Choose "Redirect Users to Home Page" and save settings. Users from mobile phones are automatically redirected to the home page of your mobile site.
